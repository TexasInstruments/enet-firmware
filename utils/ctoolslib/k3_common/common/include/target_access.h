* @brief Target access data structure definition
*
* The target access data structure encapsulates the target access helper (needed for
* remote environment) as well as the configuration base address of the IP driver for
* memory accesses. This allows the IP driver to only pass in the offset address to the
* memory API and be base address agnostic. It will be the responsibility of the higher
* layer to create the handle and pass it to the IP driver.
*
* @param helper Pointer to helper function if needed
* @param base_address Target base address

/**
* @brief Target register and memory access API defintions.
*
* A common API is defined for memmory and register accesses whether the IP driver is
* running on the remote host or in a self-hosted/local environment. Only include this
* file in the IP driver and the relevant dependent header file will be pulled in 
* depending on the environment.
*
* Requirements
* 1) Direct access for self hosted and local environment
* 2) Callback handle for remote environment
* 3) Direct register access using mnemonics for self hosted environment
*
* @params
* 1. access_handle: This is the target access handle passed to the IP driver as a
*                   target_access_handle_t type. The handle encapsulates the helper
*                   and the base address. The helper is unused for self and local
*                   environment and relevant only in the remote environment. It is
*                   expected that a higher level will create the target access handle
*                   and pass it to the IP driver during the open call.
* 2. element_name : This is the string name of the element and is used for logging the
                    call. If NULL is supplied then the call will not be logged.
* 3. element_id   : This is the config "offset" address for memory accesses and register
*                   name for register access.
* 4. storage      : Pointer to the variable that either contains the data for a write
*                   operation or the data which will hold the read value.
* 5. type         : For memory access the keyword is MEM for register it is REG.
*
* @return The macro APIs return an td_error_t type value.
*
* Examples
*
* Assume: IP driver was passed in "target_access" of type target_access_handle_t
* during the open call.
*
* 1. Read a 32 bit memory mapped register
*       uint32_t reg_val;
*       uint32_t offset_address = ADTF_LOCK_STATUS;
*       READ_32(target_access, "ADTF_LOCK_STATUS", offset_address, &reg_val, MEM);
* 2. Write to a 16-bit register
*       uint32_t reg_val = 0xABCD;
*       WRITE_16(target_access, "TCU_CTRL", TCU_CTRL, &reg_val, REG);
*    Here TCU_CTRL is either a directly mapped mnemonic in the hosted environment which
*    is recognized by the compiler or maps to a string name in the remote environment.
